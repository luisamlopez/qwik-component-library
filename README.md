# Project Name: Qwik Component Repository

## Overview

This project focuses on the development of a component repository using the Qwik framework for internal use by developers at LCC Opentech. The goal is to streamline the front-end development process and enhance component reusability within the company.

## Project Description

The project began with a comprehensive analysis, including a semi-structured interview with clients to gather functional and non-functional requirements. Understanding the clients' needs and the existing front-end development workflow at Opentech was crucial. Leveraging documentation provided by the company, the development environment was set up.

Components were developed using JSX and the TypeScript programming language, adhering to the Qwik framework. Integration with Storybook facilitated testing and documentation for each component. The results achieved align with the specific objectives and requirements outlined by the company.

## Tools Used

- Qwik Framework: Used as the foundation for developing efficient and reusable components.
- TypeScript: Chosen for its statically-typed nature, enhancing code reliability.
- Storybook: Integrated for component testing and documentation.
